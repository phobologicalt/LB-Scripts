# LB-Scripts
the goal of this project is to make alot of liquidbounce scripts avilable in one place, and not from sketchy websites from videos on youtube or all over git and discord.
By the way the files like "!fly.js"  are only named like that to stay near the top. My bad if there are duplicates.
# Liability
